# ADB-3020-CDV

The ADB-3020 is an excellent switching power supply designed by an Italian team and licensed under CreativeCommon (the original project is in the adb_2030_Original directory)
The CDV (Community Digital Version) fork is intended to start with version 2.1 (last published on the fork date) and then extend it with digital functions via MCU.

The project starts with the creation of Eagle .sch and .brd files because the original authors have decided not to release those files.
